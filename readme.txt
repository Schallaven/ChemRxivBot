You will need three supporting files in the same directory as CRXBot.py to run this code:

1)id_log.txt (stores the IDs that have already been processed to prevent duplication)
2)activity_log.txt (stores output information & error messages from the write_log command)

Both of the above can be blank for the first run.

3)CRX_keys.txt (contains the credentials for the associated Twitter account & ChemRxiv access token)

Use CRX_keys.txt to store the tokens and Keys

Format the file like this, with no additional text in the document:
twitKey
twitSecret
twitToken
twitToken_secret
chemRxiv_token
